## M3 VSR — done vs. hardening backlog (honest)

**Working & sim-tested (4 deterministic invariants green):** normal-case
replication, group-commit-compatible apply, exactly-once client table, primary
failover via view change with best-log selection, gap state transfer, retransmit
recovery. Tests: linearizable-vs-reference (single-client total order),
same-seed determinism, primary-crash → view-change → progress + survivor
convergence, convergence under 25% message loss.

**Explicit hardening backlog (NOT yet done — listed, not hidden):**
asymmetric network-partition matrix, disk corruption *during* a view change,
large randomized seed-corpus sweep (CI), real socket transport (currently
in-process deterministic bus only), cluster membership reconfiguration. These
are tracked for M3-hardening / later specs; the protocol is transport-agnostic
so the socket swap is mechanical.

## Sub-project 2 — variable-length overflow store (done)

Object types can have `OverflowRef` fields carrying arbitrary-length bytes
while the core record stays fixed-width. Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-kesseldb-subproject2-overflow.md`.

- Write side rides inside `Create`/`Update` records as a trailer
  (`[fixed][u16 n]( [u16 field_idx][u32 len][bytes] )*`), so it's part of the
  replicated op — every replica writes identical bytes.
- Handle = `(op_number << 20) | field_idx` — deterministic, no counter/RNG,
  identical across replicas (proven: replicated-convergence test + a
  two-instance digest-equality test).
- Read via `Op::GetBlob { handle }`. Overflow lives in a reserved LSM
  keyspace, so it inherits crash recovery, the digest, and replication.
- **Honest limitation:** no overflow GC — an `Update` orphans the old blob
  (still resolvable; documented and asserted by `update_orphans_old_blob…`).
  Orphan compaction is a later spec.

## Sub-project 3 — equality secondary indexes (done)

`CreateIndex(type_id, field_id)` + `FindBy(type_id, field_id, value)`.
Replication-correct (content-derived keys, sorted id sets, digest-covered),
deterministic backfill of pre-existing rows, maintained on Create/Update/
Delete. Added `Storage::scan_range`. Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-kesseldb-subproject3-indexes.md`.
**Honest limits:** equality only (no range / multi-index planner — next
spec); read-modify-write per index op (correct, not yet throughput-optimized);
`OverflowRef` fields not indexable.

## Sub-project 4 — UNIQUE + NOT NULL constraints (done)

`OpResult::Constraint`, NOT NULL from `Field.nullable` (codec-record scoped),
UNIQUE via the SP3 index (`ObjectType.unique`), `Op::AddUnique` that validates
existing data before enabling. Deterministic + replicated-convergence tested.
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-kesseldb-subproject4-constraints.md`.
**Honest limits:** only NOT NULL + UNIQUE (FK/CHECK/balance-guard/WASM
deferred); NOT NULL enforced for codec records only; UNIQUE uses the SP3
read-modify-write path.

## Sub-project 5 — query planner (done)

`Op::Query` = AND of Eq/Ge/Le predicates. Planner intersects indexed-equality
id sets then post-filters; otherwise a filtered `scan_range`. Per-kind numeric
comparison (correct range on LE integers). Read-only, deterministic (digest
unchanged). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-kesseldb-subproject5-query.md`.
**Honest limits:** AND-only (no OR/NOT), no order-preserving range index
(range = scan/post-filter), no cost-based intersection ordering.

## Sub-project 6 — foreign keys (done)

`ObjectType.fks`, `Op::AddForeignKey` (validates existing rows before
enabling, idempotent), ref-exists enforced on Create/Update (codec-record
scoped, NULL skipped), deterministic + VSR-convergence tested. Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-kesseldb-subproject6-fk.md`.
**Honest limit:** no `ON DELETE`/`ON UPDATE` referential actions — deleting
a parent neither cascades nor is blocked (FK checked only on child write);
single-field FK only.

## Sub-project 7 — deterministic expression VM + CHECK (done)

`kessel-expr`: zero-dependency, pure, gas-bounded, terminating stack
bytecode VM. `ObjectType.checks` + `Op::AddCheck` (validates structure +
all existing rows before enabling). Enforced on create/update; rejects on
false or any VM error. 3-node VSR convergence tested. Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-kesseldb-subproject7-check-vm.md`.
**This is the revolutionary core** — user logic, deterministic, inside the
replicated state machine. **Honest limits:** predicate-only (no mutation —
that's SP8 triggers, same VM); single-row; no aggregates; u128-high-bit edge.

## What this is NOT (yet)

Still out of scope (each a later spec): deterministic triggers (mutating, SP8),
ON DELETE/UPDATE referential actions, OR/NOT queries, order-preserving range
index, balance-guard constraint, destructive ALTER/DROP, overflow GC,
index-write throughput optimization, M3 hardening backlog (partition matrix,
disk-fault-in-VC, seed-corpus sweep, socket transport, membership), client SDKs.

## Performance log

### M1 standalone storage (localhost, single-thread, MemVfs in-memory, no real fsync, unoptimized)

- PUT: ~254,000 ops/s (128B records)
- GET: ~137,000 ops/s (128B records)

**Honest reading:** modest and far below TigerBeetle-class numbers — expected at M1
(unoptimized, single-thread, value-cloning hot path). The notable finding is GET < PUT:
`get()` is O(#sstables) with a binary search + full value clone per table and no bloom
filter. This is a known architectural debt earmarked for M4 perf work (bloom filters,
level compaction, zero-copy reads), recorded here rather than hidden. The first
*thesis-relevant* number is the M2 single-node state-machine benchmark.

### M2 single-node state machine (localhost, single-thread, 128B TB-equivalent record)

| Path | CREATE | GET |
|---|---|---|
| MemVfs, per-op (in-mem upper bound) | ~245K ops/s | ~589K ops/s |
| MemVfs, generalized (codec) | ~205K ops/s | — |
| DirVfs real fsync, **per-op** | **2,339 ops/s** | ~2.0M ops/s |
| DirVfs real fsync, **batch=1000 (group commit)** | **87,338 ops/s** | ~1.05M ops/s |

GET fast on DirVfs because post-flush data sits in OS-cached SSTables; the slower
MemVfs GET reflects the known O(#sstables) read path (no bloom filter yet, M4 work).

### M2 go/no-go verdict: CONDITIONAL GO

The spec's M2 gate asks: is the generalization cost fatal before we invest in VSR?

- **Generalization cost is NOT fatal.** Schema-driven codec records cost ~20% vs a
  raw fixed type (205K vs 245K create) — comfortably within the spec's ≥70%-of-kernel
  intent. The flexibility layer is cheap.
- **The real gap vs TigerBeetle (~1M+/s) was batching, not flexibility.** Naive
  per-op fsync = 2,339/s (purely fsync-bound: p50 395µs ≈ one Windows fsync).
  Adding TB-style **group commit** (one fsync per batch) took the durable path to
  **87,338/s — a 37× win** — with a single, well-understood change. With larger
  batches / parallel fsync / faster storage this scales further; the thesis that
  "schema flexibility at TB-class speed" is achievable is **supported, not refuted**,
  conditional on batched group commit (now implemented) and the remaining M4 perf
  work (bloom filters, zero-copy reads, level compaction).

Confirming evidence: with MemVfs (no real fsync) batch=1000 gives ~242K/s ≈ the
~245K/s per-op number — batching changes nothing in-memory. It only helps on real
disk (2,339 → 87,338). That isolates fsync as the *sole* bottleneck of the naive
path, exactly as the thesis analysis predicted.

**Decision:** proceed to M3 (VSR). The VSR primary will hand committed *batches* to
`StateMachine::apply_batch`, so replication and group commit compose naturally.

### M4 replicated + cache + sharding

- **3-node replicated CREATE: ~161,000 ops/s**, all replicas converged
  (in-process deterministic bus + MemVfs). This isolates **consensus/commit
  overhead only** — no network, no fsync. Single-node MemVfs create was ~245K/s,
  so the replication protocol overhead at this layer is ~35% (245K → 161K),
  which is reasonable for quorum replication.
- **Read cache:** correctness proven (`cache_on_equals_cache_off`: identical op
  results AND identical state digest over a 3,000-op random stream). It is
  observably invisible to the replicated core; value is workload-dependent
  (hit-rate metric exposed via `cache_hit_rate()`), so its speedup is
  characterized qualitatively, not over-claimed with a synthetic number.
- **Sharding:** rendezvous-hash routing, deterministic & ~balanced (<15% skew
  over 8 shards), <30% remap on 4→5 resize. Single-shard today; cross-shard
  transactions explicitly deferred (documented in ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Cloud-scaling speculation (reasoned, NOT measured)

All numbers above are a single localhost machine. Extrapolating honestly:

1. **Durability is the dominant cloud cost.** Per-op fsync was 2.3K/s; group
   commit took it to 87K/s locally. Cloud NVMe fsync (~50–200µs) with batches
   of ~1–8K ops/fsync (TB-style) projects to **roughly 0.5–3M durable ops/s
   per node** — the thesis-relevant regime — but this is an extrapolation from
   the measured 37× batching win, not a cloud measurement.
2. **Replication adds RTT, not CPU.** The ~35% protocol overhead measured here
   is CPU/structural. In a cloud region, intra-AZ RTT (~0.1–0.5ms) is hidden by
   pipelining/batching (many ops in flight per round-trip) — throughput stays
   storage-bound; **p99 latency rises by ~1 RTT**, not throughput collapse.
   Cross-region replication would materially raise commit latency (10–80ms RTT)
   and is a deployment-topology decision, not an engine limit.
3. **Sharding is the horizontal-scale lever.** With independent VSR groups per
   shard and rendezvous routing, single-shard-key throughput scales ~linearly
   with shard count until the client/router fans out — bounded by the (deferred)
   cross-shard-transaction fraction of the workload.
4. **Known ceilings before any cloud claim is credible:** O(#sstables) reads
   (no bloom filter), value-cloning hot path, single-threaded core, in-process
   (not socket) transport. These are the M4-hardening / Sub-project-2+ backlog;
   until they're addressed, treat all projections as upper-bound reasoning.

**Bottom line:** the data supports "schema flexibility at TB-class speed is
*achievable*" — generalization costs ~20%, replication ~35%, and the historical
400× gap was batching (now fixed). It does not yet *demonstrate* TB-class
absolute numbers; that requires the hardening backlog and real hardware.
